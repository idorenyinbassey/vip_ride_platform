VIP Ride Platform - Manual Cleanup Recommendations
==================================================

SAFE TO DELETE (after verification):
- pricing/models_backup.py (minimal backup)
- pricing/models_new.py and models_simple.py (if models.py is current)
- One of: core/encryption.py OR gps_tracking/encryption.py (keep the one being imported)

FILES TO KEEP:
- All __init__.py files (required for Python packages)
- pricing/models.py (main models file)
- accounts/payment_service.py (main payment service)
- vip_ride_platform/api_views.py (main API views)

FLUTTER FILES:
- Regular and VIP client app files appear to have clean backups removed

VERIFICATION COMMANDS:
To check which encryption file is being used:
  grep -r "from.*encryption import" . --exclude-dir=.venv
  grep -r "import.*encryption" . --exclude-dir=.venv

To check model imports:
  grep -r "from pricing.models" . --exclude-dir=.venv
  grep -r "import.*models" . --include="*.py" --exclude-dir=.venv

NEXT STEPS:
1. Run this script: bash safe_cleanup.sh
2. Review the manual_cleanup_recommendations.txt
3. Test the application to ensure nothing breaks
4. Remove the remaining duplicates manually after verification
